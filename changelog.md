## Version `0.9.1`
- moved init to custom_init, now init doesn't take parameters and just calls custom_init with default values (`true, false`), shouldn't break anything on previous scripts, but those might unnecesary parameters.

## Version `0.9 - 2`
- added `only_one` parameter to `add_shop_chance`, use to only allow one of that item per shop

## Version `0.9 - 1`
- fixed and changed transition info of hired hands (previously didn't work with many hired hands)

## There are versions previous to those, but most don't change anything important
